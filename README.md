# my-site
Site to display music, audio visualization, and perhaps even some fun facts. WIP

Currently, due to the authentification tokens and etc etc that I have to keep in my index files while it's in production and being tested, I can't publicly post the repo so it's nice and cozy inside a private one. Once it's done I'm just going to clone it and take all the sensitive information away.
